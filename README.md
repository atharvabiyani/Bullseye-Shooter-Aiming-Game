# Bullseye-Shooter-Aiming-Game
The main objective of our project is to create an interactive aim game where users will practice their shooting accuracy by aiming at bullseyes using their mouse. The game will be simple but engaging, with multiple difficulty levels, varying target sizes, and different bullseye movement patterns to enhance the gaming experience. The user will aim and shoot with their mouse, and the game will track accuracy, providing real-time feedback.

# Tools/System/Software:
Unity: Primary development platform for creating the game, handling graphics rendering, physics, and user interaction.
C#: Programming language for scripting game logic, user interactions, and scoring systems within Unity.
GitHub: Version control system for managing the project repository, allowing team members to collaborate seamlessly.
Visual Studio: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and debugging C# code.
Windows/Linux: Target operating systems where the game will be developed and tested.
